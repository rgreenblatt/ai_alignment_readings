Lets talk about interpretability + transparency this week.
Needed Background:
 - https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety
 - https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/

Some questions to think about on this background:
 - How good do you think humans could get at the auditing game (discussed in alignmentforum post)?
 - Would ability in things like the auditing game generalize to detecting issues in actual AIs?
 - How do you think interpretability changes as AI 'power' varies?
 - Prior to reading the distill post on circuits, how identifiable do you think circuits will be? Try to build an intuition for what you would expect in terms of analysis and then see if the article matches your expectation.

Now let's play with OpenAI microscope: https://microscope.openai.com/models
Take a look at the visualization for ResNet (ImageNet) and for CLIP ResNet (you can skim through this: https://openai.com/blog/clip/ to get a sense for what CLIP is).
Any sizes (101/50 4x/50 16x) are fine to explore for CLIP ResNet.
Here are some relevant questions you should be able to answer (to some extent):
 - How do feature visualizations tend to vary from the image input side to the other side of the network? What does this indicate about how CNNs work?
 - For ResNet, try to predict the large activation dataset samples from the feature visualization. Also, the other way around. When is this prediction easy?
 - Try to do the same thing for CLIP. You may notice something strange about the highest activation dataset samples as compared to ResNet trained on ImageNet.
 - Try to find interesting examples/observations in general. If you do find any, please either share in the chat or share during the meeting.


I think this is probably sufficient for our next meeting.


On the subject of interpretability here are some (optional) things which you should consider reading:
 - https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/
 - https://distill.pub/2020/understanding-rl-vision/
 - Anything from https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/

These are also potential papers to present on in the future.
In general, if you have a paper which you would like to present to the group, go for it! (this is probably a more valuable format in general)
