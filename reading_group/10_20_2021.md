We went over CIRL and some associated papers. Specifically:

- Discussion (minimal notes):
  - Approaches to accomplishing task:
    - manual programming
    - RL (requires known reward function)
    - Imitation learning + IRL (inverse reinforcement learning)
    - CIRL
    - Apprenticeship learning (possibly with CIRL)
  - human may alter behavior from individually optimal for IRL to improve
    robot behavior (see figure 1 in CIRL paper)
  - in other words, 'Demonstration By Expert' isn't necessarily best response
    to IRL
