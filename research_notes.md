- Consider asking: 'who's shoulders can I stand on?' Possible ways to answer this:
  1. Read the Wikipedia article on the subject, and glance over the references.
  2. Read the article on the subject in a field-specific encyclopedia.
  3. Read or skim-read an entry-level university textbook on the subject.

- autodidactory
- review article + textbooks best 
  - edited volume of review articles even better
  - handbook also very good
  - entry level textbooks better for basic questions
  - important to have right terminology to find the thing
  - use google scholar, review often highly cited 
- go granular, but focus on abstracts/skimming important sections

- [https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jfHPBbYFzCrbdEXXd/how-to-succeed-as-an-early-stage-researcher-the-lean-startup](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jfHPBbYFzCrbdEXXd/how-to-succeed-as-an-early-stage-researcher-the-lean-startup)
- think as entrepreneur trying to build products for customers (less relevant
  when attached to org)
- problems
  - all project ideas bad
    - get advice/feedback from others on ideas (generate many)
    - notice interest
    - social consensus/established paradigm approach (have to understand
      underlying motivation, probably doesn't as apply much in technical
      alignment work)
    - theory of change/why we care
    - seek topics which can be supervised
    - prefer empirical work
  - no one will read anything you write
    - solve project idea problem
    - good title + summary
    - elegance
    - focus on first parts
    - go narrow
    - lots of editing
    - market
    - co author
- concern: maybe you have really good vision (black swan) and customer doesn't
  know what they want
  - "just trust your intuitions man. Either your intuitions are good or they're
    bad. If they are good you should mostly trust your intuitions regardless of
    what other people say, and if they're bad, well, you aren't going to be a
    good researcher anyway." - [Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyhCTvrEtE)
- need to immerse in intellectual community even though you don't have much to
  add
- don't get depressed
