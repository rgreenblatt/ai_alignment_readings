# Research as a Stochastic Decision Process

- [https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html)
- simplify choice to maximizing failure rate per unit time
- compute via using Poisson arrival process \lambda
- computed as log(1 / proc_succ) / time
- also consider when to develop tooling (beginning seems appealing, but results
  in worse design as less is known)
- look for counterexamples
- consider also learning over time (maybe ideas on later task come from earlier
  task)

# The neglected virtue of scholarship

- [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/64FdKLwmea8MCLWkE/the-neglected-virtue-of-scholarship](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/64FdKLwmea8MCLWkE/the-neglected-virtue-of-scholarship)
- important to just be up to date on the well worn path of knowledge
- Consider asking: 'who's shoulders can I stand on?' Possible ways to answer this:
  1. Read the Wikipedia article on the subject, and glance over the references.
  2. Read the article on the subject in a field-specific encyclopedia.
  3. Read or skim-read an entry-level university textbook on the subject.

# Scholarship: How to Do It Efficiently

- [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently)
- autodidactory
- review article + textbooks best
  - edited volume of review articles even better
  - handbook also very good
  - entry level textbooks better for basic questions
  - important to have right terminology to find the thing
  - use google scholar, review often highly cited
- go granular, but focus on abstracts/skimming important sections
- see [this comment about getting pdfs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently?commentId=9CyMrowH93Na6qdbN)

# Costs and benefits of scholarship

- can be hard to find all literature, but sometimes you get lucky
- some other costs, don't think very important atm

- reference as needed. (lazily add notes)

# How to succeed as an early-stage researcher: the “lean startup” approach

- [https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jfHPBbYFzCrbdEXXd/how-to-succeed-as-an-early-stage-researcher-the-lean-startup](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jfHPBbYFzCrbdEXXd/how-to-succeed-as-an-early-stage-researcher-the-lean-startup)
- think as entrepreneur trying to build products for customers (less relevant
  when attached to org)
- problems
  - all project ideas bad
    - get advice/feedback from others on ideas (generate many)
    - notice interest
    - social consensus/established paradigm approach (have to understand
      underlying motivation, probably doesn't as apply much in technical
      alignment work)
    - theory of change/why we care
    - seek topics which can be supervised
    - prefer empirical work
  - no one will read anything you write
    - solve project idea problem
    - good title + summary
    - elegance
    - focus on first parts
    - go narrow
    - lots of editing
    - market
    - co author
- concern: maybe you have really good vision (black swan) and customer doesn't
  know what they want
  - "just trust your intuitions man. Either your intuitions are good or they're
    bad. If they are good you should mostly trust your intuitions regardless of
    what other people say, and if they're bad, well, you aren't going to be a
    good researcher anyway." - [Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyhCTvrEtE)
- need to immerse in intellectual community even though you don't have much to
  add
- don't get depressed

# How to generate research proposals

- note down interesting research questions and get (fast) feedback
- read agendas and talk to people to find disagreements
- think about attributes of good project to build taste
- fail fast, don't be afraid to quit, stochastic process approach to research
- don't spend too long on meta choices (fixed max time)
- just pick meta choice and try to fail fast

- emphasis on convenience
- some thinking habits and mindset stuff of note.
